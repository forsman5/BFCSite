 I am a third year Public Affairs and Political Science double major. I have been involved in fencing since middle school, starting at Kiraly Fencing Academy in Akron. I've been a member of the Fencing Club at Ohio State since my freshman year. My interests outside of fencing include politics, attending concerts, collecting vinyl, and the Bee Movie.
