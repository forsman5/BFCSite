I have been fencing for four years now and I am currently the foil captain and coach of the club. I enjoy teaching people of all skill levels and learning anything I can to improve my, and others, fencing. Off the piste, I am an Engineering Physics major who is interested in researching nuclear fusion as a source of clean energy.
