 I have been fencing and have taught fencing since 2009. I have served multiple positions throughout my years at the club including: president, vice-president, epee captain, and, currently saber captain. I am eager to spend my last year at OSU teaching, welcoming new members, and improving the club any way he can. I am not a cyborg.
